- To run app, navigate to ionic directory, and type "ionic serve" in command prompt

- Most of the work should be done within the src folder (ionic/src)

- The menu tabs at the bottom of app page is controlled by App.tsx file (ionic/src/App.tsx)

- Icons for the menu can be found from website: https://ionicons.com/ or folder (ionic/node_modules/ionicons)

- The specific tabs are controlled by the files within the pages directory (ionic/src/pages)

- Tab 1 represents Menu

- Tab 2 represents Pytutor

- Tab 3 represents Settings

- The icon that will display on home screen of mobile devices can be found within resources folder (ionic/resources)

- For a page to be displayed within ionic application, I think that it must be iframe compatible
